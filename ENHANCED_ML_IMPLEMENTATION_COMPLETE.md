## **ðŸš€ HOW THE SYSTEMS WORK TOGETHER**

### **Example Student Learning Journey:**

1. **Initial Assessment**
   ```
   POST /api/v1/kt/update-knowledge
   - Student attempts: Time & Work question
   - System calculates: Mastery level 2.3/10.0 (Developing)
   - Interpretation: "Understands basics, needs more practice"
   ```

2. **Personalized Content Generation**
   ```
   POST /api/v1/nlp/generate-explanation
   - Input: concept="Time & Work", mastery_level=2.3, learning_style="visual"
   - Output: Visual diagrams + basic examples + step-by-step guide
   ```

3. **Adaptive Practice**
   ```
   POST /api/v1/adaptive/adaptive-test/learning
   - Generates: 15 questions focusing on Time & Work
   - Difficulty: Starts at 2.5/10, adapts based on performance
   - Features: Immediate feedback + hints enabled
   ```

4. **Spaced Repetition Schedule**
   ```
   POST /api/v1/sr/advanced-schedule
   - Current mastery: 2.3/10.0
   - Next review: 12 hours (because mastery < 3.0)
   - Priority: High (weak area)
   ```

5. **Mock Test (When Ready)**
   ```
   POST /api/v1/adaptive/mock-test/full-ssc
   - Condition: Only when mastery >= 5.0 for exam topics
   - Test: 100% SSC CGL Tier-1 pattern compliance
