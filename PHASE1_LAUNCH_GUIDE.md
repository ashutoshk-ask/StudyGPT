## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

#### **1. ML Backend Not Starting:**
```bash
# Check if port 8001 is in use
netstat -an | grep 8001

# If occupied, kill the process or change port in config.py
```

#### **2. Docker Services Not Starting:**
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker info

# Restart Docker Desktop if on Windows/Mac
# Or restart Docker daemon on Linux
```

#### **3. Database Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL in .env file
# Should match your Neon database credentials
```

#### **4. Mock Tests Not Generating:**
```bash
# Check if you have 450 questions in database
# Run: node -e "console.log('Checking database...'); process.exit(0)"
```
